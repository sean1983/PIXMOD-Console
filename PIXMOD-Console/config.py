# Which serial port the Arduino is connected to. You can find this with the Arduino IDE or follow these instructions:

# Set to True if using a lower power microcontroller (like an Arduino Nano instead of ESP board) and you have issues
WAIT_BEFORE_SEND = True

# Experimentally determined to be 700 microseconds, now we think it's 694.44. It needs to be an integer for this
# codebase to function, though, which is why 694 is the default here
