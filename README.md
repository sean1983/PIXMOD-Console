# PIXMOD Console

## Overview
The PIXMOD Console let's you   generate and transmit Infrared  sequences, enabling control of Pixmob wristbands and other pixmob device's.

## Hardware Requirements
1. An Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32 or simlar compatible (MCU) microcontroller.
2. A 940nm Infrared LED and a 200Î© Resistor or Prebuilt Emitter.
3. Computer running Windows, Linux or OSX, For uploading Arduino Sketch and running PIXMOD Console.

## Getting Started
You'll first need the Arduino Sender Sketch on Dani's Github here:<br />
[PixMob IR (and RF!) Reverse Engineering Project](https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering/tree/main/arduino_sender)

### Steps
Follow these steps to set up your DIY Infrared Transmitter:

1. Connect an IR LED/transmitter to the MCU board.

2. Connect the MCU to a computer via USB.

3. Upload the sketch from [here](https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering/tree/main/arduino_sender) to the MCU.

  #### Examples
- *Note the serial port/device address of the MCU*
  - **Window:** COM***x***
  - **Linux:** /dev/ttyUSB***x***
  - **OSX:** /dev/tty.usb***x***
  
4. Set the serial port using  *ARDUINO_SERIAL_PORT* in **config.py**.
*If using a low-power Arduino device like an Arduino Nano, also set `WAIT_BEFORE_SEND` to True.*

5. Install the Python Libraries using:
    ``` pip install -r ./requirements.txt ```

6. Run the PIXMOD Console.

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE with the following libraries:
  - IRremote *(Use for Arduinio UNO & Mega)*
  - IRremoteESP8266 *(Use for ESP8266 & ESP32)*
    - ***Version 2.0.17*** *(Version 3+ has issues)*

- Python 3.11 or later with the following libraries:
  - pyperclip==1.9.0
  - pyserial==3.5
  - PySimpleGUI==5.0.6
  - PySimpleGUI==5.0.6
  - config==0.5.1

## Contributing
Contributions to the PIXMOD Console are welcome! Whether it's refining the code, adding new features, or improving documentation, we appreciate your help in making this project better.
